### travel points request API.

-   worker_id: identification of the worker you want to process this task. must be prefixed by "travelbot_", and suffixed by the name of the country, e.g. "slovenia", "turkey".

### travel points response API:

-   responses are always BZIP2 compressed.
-   need to stream-encode the JSON, and stream that into the BZIP2 compressor; verify by checking memory usage.
-   travel_points: list of travel points.
